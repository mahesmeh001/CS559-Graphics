# CS559-Graphics
These are my projects for the computer science graphics course. 
Each project folder has a README file which contains the projects requirements. 

Especially notable projects: 
Project 5: the requirements called for a parametric curve in 2D, but I took the initiavite, knowing that 3D modeling was coming up in the near future, to represent my parametric curve in 3D.
